<u>Hii my name is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cluie.somewhere/">khushi  vishwakaram</a>
</u><<br>
I studied from class 1st to 8th at beneras public school
and from class 9th to 12th at sri ram comvent
in class 11th,I pursued the PCM stream, but in class 12th 
my percentage was quite low.
I feel very shy to share my percentage in front of everyone.
What can i do?
the time has passed,hoping for a better tomorrow.
<b><h4>thanks you</h4></b>
