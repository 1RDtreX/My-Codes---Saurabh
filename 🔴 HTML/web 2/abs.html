<h2>Abstraction in OOP</h2>
Definition:<br>
Abstraction is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It involves hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the necessary and relevant parts to the user. This simplifies interaction with the system and reduces complexity.<br><br>

Key Concepts:<br>

Interface and Implementation:<br>
Abstraction separates what an object does from how it does it. The user interacts with the object's interface (methods and properties) without needing to understand the underlying implementation.<br><br>

Focus on Essential Features:<br>
It allows developers to focus on the essential attributes and behaviors of an object rather than all its details. This makes it easier to understand and use objects in the system.<br><br>

Information Hiding:<br>
Abstraction helps in hiding the internal workings of objects. By exposing only the necessary details, it protects the integrity of the data and prevents unauthorized access and modification.<br><br>
